# Token Minting App
Welcome to my DTP Minting App, built using ChatGPT, Solidity, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS.
This app is a basic token minting application that runs on the Goerli test network and is currently under development.

The aim of this app is to allow users to mint their own tokens and use them for various purposes like creating digital assets, rewards, and more. The app is built on the Ethereum blockchain and utilizes the power of smart contracts to mint and manage the tokens.

The developer of this app is Daniel Chrostowski, and the private keys and addresses used in this project are currently disposable and for testing purposes only.

The app is currently in development, and there may be bugs or issues that need to be addressed. If you encounter any issues or have any suggestions, please feel free to contact the developer.

Please note that this is a test application and should not be used for any real-world transactions or investments.

Thank you for trying out the DTP Minting App.

## Usage
To use the app, you will need to have an Ethereum wallet with some test Ether (Goerli) in it. You can use MetaMask or any other wallet that supports Goerli test network.

Once you have set up your wallet, you can use the app to mint tokens. Simply enter the number of tokens you wish to mint and click on the mint button. The tokens will be minted and added to your wallet.

Please note that the app is still in development and may not function as intended. Use it at your own risk.

## Development
This app is currently under development and is open for contributions. If you are interested in contributing to the development of the app, please reach out to the developer.

The app is built using ChatGPT, Solidity, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. Knowledge in these technologies is required to contribute to the development of the app.

The app is currently deployed on the Goerli test network and will continue to be tested and improved upon. The developer is open to suggestions and feedback to improve the functionality and user experience of the app.

Please note that this app is for educational and testing purposes only. Do not use it for real-world transactions or investments.

Thank you for your interest in the DTP Minting App. We hope you find it useful and we look forward to your contributions.
